change the config to include the stlink and debuging like in kieals like gdb that i can look at the registors when program running on board
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç You want to extend your current Emacs setup so you can flash/debug your STM32F072 board via ST-Link and use GDB inside Emacs (with register/variable inspection like Kiel).

Here‚Äôs how we can change your config:
üîß Requirements

    stlink-tools (for st-flash, st-util)

    arm-none-eabi-gdb (from ARM toolchain)

    openocd (alternative to st-util, if you prefer)

Install (Ubuntu example):

sudo apt install stlink-tools openocd gdb-multiarch

üõ† Updated Emacs Config (Additions for STM32 Debugging)

;; --------------------------------------------------
;; Embedded Development: STM32 + ST-Link + GDB
;; --------------------------------------------------

;; Load gdb-mi frontend (already included in Emacs)
(setq gdb-many-windows t)        ;; Kiel-like multi-window view
(setq gdb-show-main t)           ;; Show main at start

;; DAP Mode with gdb
(use-package dap-mode
  :after lsp-mode
  :config
  (dap-auto-configure-mode)
  ;; Register gdb as debug adapter
  (require 'dap-gdb-lldb)
  ;; Define a debug template for STM32
  (dap-register-debug-template "STM32 GDB"
    (list :type "gdb"
          :request "launch"
          :name "STM32F072 Debug"
          :gdbpath "arm-none-eabi-gdb" ;; or gdb-multiarch
          :target nil
          :cwd nil)))

;; Optional: integration with CMake/Make
(use-package cmake-mode)
(use-package compile
  :ensure nil
  :config
  ;; Flash board after successful build
  (setq compilation-finish-functions
        (lambda (buf str)
          (when (string-match "finished" str)
            (shell-command "st-flash write build/myprog.bin 0x8000000")))))

;; Custom command: attach to running firmware with ST-Link + gdb
(defun stm32-gdb-attach ()
  "Attach arm-none-eabi-gdb to STM32 via st-util (ST-Link)."
  (interactive)
  ;; Start st-util in background (port 4242)
  (start-process "st-util" "*st-util*" "st-util")
  ;; Open GDB in Emacs
  (gdb "arm-none-eabi-gdb build/myprog.elf -ex 'target extended-remote :4242'"))

‚ö° Workflow inside Emacs

    Build your firmware

        Use M-x compile ‚Üí runs make or cmake

        On success, it flashes .bin via st-flash

    Run Debugger

        M-x stm32-gdb-attach

        This starts st-util (which exposes STM32 over TCP port 4242)

        Then Emacs launches arm-none-eabi-gdb with your .elf file

        Registers, stack, locals, etc. available in GUD multi-window (like Kiel)

    Inspect Registers
    Inside gdb buffer:

    (gdb) info registers
    (gdb) monitor reset halt
    (gdb) load

üëâ You can switch between st-util or openocd.
If using openocd, replace the attach command with:

(gdb "arm-none-eabi-gdb build/myprog.elf -ex 'target extended-remote localhost:3333'")

and run openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f0x.cfg.

Would you like me to set up dap-mode templates so you can use breakpoints/stepping directly from Emacs like VSCode, or do you prefer sticking to plain GDB multi-window inside Emacs (closer to Kiel style)?
You said:
using arch linux
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç since you‚Äôre on Arch Linux, the toolchain and ST-Link utilities are easy to set up. Let me tailor the setup for Arch + Emacs.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

On Arch Linux:

sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gdb arm-none-eabi-binutils arm-none-eabi-gcc stlink openocd

That gives you:

    arm-none-eabi-gdb ‚Üí debugger

    st-util & st-flash ‚Üí ST-Link tools

    openocd ‚Üí alternative debugging server

2Ô∏è‚É£ Emacs Config Update

Extend your current config with this (just append):

;; --------------------------------------------------
;; STM32 Development (Arch Linux) with ST-Link + GDB
;; --------------------------------------------------

;; Use Kiel-like gdb multi-window layout
(setq gdb-many-windows t)
(setq gdb-show-main t)

(use-package dap-mode
  :after lsp-mode
  :config
  (dap-auto-configure-mode)
  (require 'dap-gdb-lldb)
  ;; Register STM32 debug template
  (dap-register-debug-template "STM32F072 Debug"
    (list :type "gdb"
          :request "launch"
          :name "STM32F072 Debug"
          :gdbpath "arm-none-eabi-gdb"
          :target nil
          :cwd nil)))

;; Custom helper to attach gdb to STM32 via st-util
(defun stm32-gdb-attach ()
  "Start st-util and connect arm-none-eabi-gdb to STM32F072."
  (interactive)
  ;; Start st-util in background (port 4242)
  (start-process "st-util" "*st-util*" "st-util")
  ;; Attach gdb to target
  (gdb "arm-none-eabi-gdb build/myprog.elf -ex 'target extended-remote :4242'"))

;; Optional: flash after compilation
(use-package compile
  :ensure nil
  :config
  (setq compilation-finish-functions
        (lambda (buf str)
          (when (string-match "finished" str)
            (shell-command "st-flash write build/myprog.bin 0x8000000")))))

3Ô∏è‚É£ Typical Workflow in Emacs (Arch)

    Build your firmware

make

or inside Emacs: M-x compile

‚Üí On success, your .bin will be flashed automatically with st-flash.

Debug the firmware
Run in Emacs:

    M-x stm32-gdb-attach

        Starts st-util in background

        Launches arm-none-eabi-gdb inside Emacs connected to STM32

    Use GDB inside Emacs
    Kiel-like multi-window UI (M-x gdb ‚Üí opens TUI):

        info registers ‚Üí check MCU registers

        break main / continue / next / step

        monitor reset halt ‚Üí reset MCU

4Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative: OpenOCD (instead of st-util)

If you want openocd instead (more scripts available):

openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f0x.cfg

Then change Emacs attach:

(gdb "arm-none-eabi-gdb build/myprog.elf -ex 'target extended-remote localhost:3333'")

‚ö° Now, you‚Äôll be able to build, flash, and debug STM32 on Arch Linux entirely inside Emacs, with register inspection like Kiel.

üëâ Do you want me to also configure dap-mode fully so you can set/clear breakpoints and step through code using Emacs keybindings (like VSCode), or just keep the plain GDB multi-window (closer to Kiel)?

full configuration for emacs
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî let‚Äôs build you a full Emacs configuration for STM32 development on Arch Linux:

    Build & Flash firmware with make + st-flash

    Debug with arm-none-eabi-gdb (via st-util or openocd)

    DAP mode integration ‚Üí breakpoints, stepping, variables, registers, all inside Emacs (like VSCode but lighter).

    Kiel-like multi-window GDB layout available if you prefer.

üîß 1. Arch Linux Packages

sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-gdb \
             stlink openocd cmake make

üîß 2. Full Emacs Config (Extended from yours)

Append this to your init.el:

;; --------------------------------------------------
;; STM32 Development Environment
;; --------------------------------------------------

;; Kiel-like gdb multi-window view
(setq gdb-many-windows t)
(setq gdb-show-main t)

;; DAP Mode (Debug Adapter Protocol)
(use-package dap-mode
  :after lsp-mode
  :config
  (dap-auto-configure-mode)
  (require 'dap-gdb-lldb)

  ;; Register debug templates for STM32
  (dap-register-debug-template "STM32F072 Debug (st-util)"
    (list :type "gdb"
          :request "launch"
          :name "STM32F072 Debug (st-util)"
          :gdbpath "arm-none-eabi-gdb"
          :target nil
          :cwd nil
          :arguments "build/myprog.elf"
          :debugPort 4242))

  (dap-register-debug-template "STM32F072 Debug (OpenOCD)"

          :cwd nil
          :arguments "build/myprog.elf"

  (gdb "arm-none-eabi-gdb build/myprog.elf -ex 'target extended-remote :4242'"))

;; Optional: Flash firmware automatically after successful build
(use-package compile
  :ensure nil
  :config
  (setq compilation-finish-functions
        (lambda (buf str)
          (when (string-match "finished" str)
            ;; Adjust path if needed
            (shell-command "st-flash write build/myprog.bin 0x08000000")))))

;; Keybindings for convenience
(global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'dap-debug)          ;; Start DAP debugger
(global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'dap-breakpoint-toggle) ;; Toggle breakpoint
(global-set-key (kbd "<f10>") 'dap-next)          ;; Step over
(global-set-key (kbd "<f11>") 'dap-step-in)       ;; Step into
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<f11>") 'dap-step-out)    ;; Step out
(global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'stm32-gdb-attach)   ;; Attach via gdb/st-util

üîß 3. Workflow in Emacs
Build + Flash

    M-x compile ‚Üí runs make
    (after success, auto-flashes .bin with st-flash)

Debugging (2 options)
a) DAP mode (VSCode-like experience)

    M-x dap-debug

    Choose "STM32F072 Debug (st-util)"

        Breakpoints ‚Üí toggle with F9

        Step over/into/out ‚Üí F10/F11/Shift+F11

        Locals, variables, call stack in separate windows

b) Classic GDB multi-window (Kiel-like)

    M-x stm32-gdb-attach

        Opens GDB inside Emacs with registers/stack view

        GDB commands available:

        info registers
        monitor reset halt
        load
        continue

üîß 4. Alternative: OpenOCD Setup

Run in a terminal:

openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f0x.cfg

Then in Emacs:

    Pick "STM32F072 Debug (OpenOCD)" from M-x dap-debug.

‚ö° This setup gives you:

    Build + Auto-flash

    DAP debugging (breakpoints, step, locals, watch)

    Kiel-style GDB multi-window if preferred

üëâ Do you want me to also add a register viewer window inside Emacs (like Kiel‚Äôs peripheral/register view) so you can see GPIO, RCC, TIM registers live, or is info registers in GDB enough for now?

Great idea üëç Let‚Äôs make a minimal bare-metal STM32F072 ‚Äúblinky add program‚Äù (we‚Äôll just add two numbers and put result in memory, so you can test toolchain, linker, startup, flash, and debugging).

üöÄ How to Test

    Build:

make

Flash:

make flash

Debug in Emacs:

    Run M-x stm32-gdb-attach

    In gdb:

        break main
        continue
        print result
        info registers

    You should see result = 42.

üëâ Do you want me to extend this to also toggle an LED on the STM32F072 board (so you can confirm code execution without debugger), or keep it strictly as a debugger test?

~/stm32f072_test $ make 
ChatGPT said:

Nice üëç your board is showing up as /dev/ttyACM0, which means the ST-Link (or onboard USB) is detected. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôll use for flashing or serial debug output.

Now, when you ran make inside ~/stm32f072_test, did it produce output like this?

arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -O0 -g -Wall -o main.elf main.c startup_stm32f072.s -T linker.ld -nostartfiles
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary main.elf main.bin

If everything is set up correctly, you should now see:

main.elf
main.bin

in your directory.
‚úÖ Next Steps

    Flash the program (make sure the board is plugged in via ST-Link or USB):

make flash

This will call:

st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000

Debug in Emacs:

    Open Emacs inside ~/stm32f072_test

    Run:

M-x stm32-gdb-attach

In GDB buffer:

    break main
    continue
    print result
    info registers

You should see:

    $1 = 42

‚ö†Ô∏è Quick check: did your make command fail with a tool not found error (arm-none-eabi-gcc: command not found)?
If yes, you‚Äôll need to install the toolchain on Arch:

sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-binutils

Do you want me to extend this ‚Äúadd test program‚Äù into a blinky on PC6 (LED on STM32F072 board) so you can confirm execution without debugger, or keep it strictly debugger-only?
You said:
make: *** No rule to make target 'startup_stm32f072.s', needed by 'main.elf'.  Stop.
ChatGPT said:

Ah ‚úÖ that error means make didn‚Äôt find startup_stm32f072.s in your project folder.
GNU Make is looking for it because the Makefile explicitly lists it as a dependency of main.elf.
üîß Fix

Make sure your project folder (~/stm32f072_test/) has these four files:

~/stm32f072_test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startup_stm32f072.s

Good catch ‚ö° ‚Äî this error happens because the STM32F072 (Cortex-M0) does not support ITTT or multi-instruction IT blocks.

On Cortex-M0 you can only use IT for one instruction at a time, not multiple. The startup_stm32f072.s I gave was closer to Cortex-M3/M4.

üîß Why this works

    Replaced ITTT/IT blocks with explicit cmp + branch (bcc) loops, which are supported on Cortex-M0.

    Now the startup is 100% ARMv6-M compatible (STM32F0).

üöÄ Next Step

    Replace your startup_stm32f072.s with this fixed version.

    Run:

make clean
make

Expected:

arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -O0 -g -Wall -o main.elf main.c startup_stm32f072.s -T linker.ld -nostartfiles
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary main.elf main.bin

Now you‚Äôll get main.elf + main.bin.

    Flash:

make flash

    Debug in Emacs:

break main
continue
print result

‚Üí should show 42.

üëâ Do you want me to also add USART2 printf support (via /dev/ttyACM0) so you can see debug output on your PC without using GDB? That‚Äôs often the next step after getting startup running.

Ah, got it üëç ‚Äî the problem is the post-indexed addressing ([r0], #4).

On Cortex-M0 (ARMv6-M) the assembler does not support writeback with immediate offset in ldr/str.
So these lines:

ldr   r3, [r0], #4
str   r3, [r1], #4

must be rewritten explicitly with manual add instructions.

    str r3, [r1]
    adds r0, r0, #4
    adds r1, r1, #4

    Same for .bss loop (str + adds r1, #4).

    This is 100% valid on Cortex-M0.

Now recompile:

make clean
make

üëâ That should build main.elf without errors.

Do you want me to also add a Makefile rule for generating .hex (since STM32CubeProgrammer often prefers .hex over .bin)?

how to debug
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî now that your C bare-metal program compiles for STM32F072, the next step is debugging. On Arch Linux, you‚Äôll be using gdb-multiarch (or arm-none-eabi-gdb) with openocd (or stlink) to connect to the board.
üîç Debugging STM32 on Arch Linux
1. Install required tools

sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gdb openocd

If you‚Äôre using an ST-Link debugger:

yay -S stlink

2. Connect hardware

    Plug in your STM32F072 board via ST-Link or onboard debugger.

    Check that it‚Äôs detected:

    lsusb | grep ST-LINK

3. Run OpenOCD

OpenOCD provides a GDB server that talks to your board.

Example for STM32F072 with ST-Link:

openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f0x.cfg

You should see something like:

Info : stm32f0x.cpu: hardware has 4 breakpoints, 2 watchpoints

This runs a GDB server on port 3333.
4. Start GDB

In another terminal, launch:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

Then connect to OpenOCD‚Äôs server:

target remote localhost:3333

5. Load program to flash

Inside gdb:

monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

This flashes your program onto the chip.
6. Debugging commands

Typical commands you‚Äôll use:

break main       # Set a breakpoint at main()
break Reset_Handler
continue         # Run program
step             # Step into
next             # Step over
info registers   # Show CPU registers
x/10x 0x20000000 # Examine memory (10 words from SRAM base)

If you want to reset and run again:

monitor reset init

7. Exit

quit

and kill OpenOCD with Ctrl+C.

‚ö° Optional tip: you can create a .gdbinit in your project folder with:

target remote localhost:3333
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

Then just run:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

and it auto-loads + flashes.

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to integrate Emacs (Arch setup) with gdb so you can step through STM32 code directly inside Emacs?
You said:
yay -S stlink yay not working
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç ‚Äî if yay isn‚Äôt available on your Arch system, that means you either don‚Äôt have an AUR helper installed or you prefer sticking to official repos.

The good news: you don‚Äôt actually need yay for stlink. On Arch Linux, the stlink package is in the official repos now. You can install it directly with pacman:

sudo pacman -S stlink

This gives you the tools:

    st-info ‚Üí query device

    st-flash ‚Üí flash binaries

    st-util ‚Üí GDB server for debugging (alternative to OpenOCD)

‚úÖ Example usage

Check device:

st-info --probe

Flash binary:

st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000

Start GDB server:

st-util

This runs a GDB server on localhost:4242.

Then in another terminal:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

Inside GDB:

target extended-remote localhost:4242
monitor reset halt
load
continue

‚ö° Question for you: Do you want me to set up your workflow with stlink only (simpler, fewer configs) or with OpenOCD (more flexible for different MCUs later)?
You said:
in emacs i already did make flash
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç if you already have make flash working in Emacs, that means you‚Äôve got a working toolchain + flashing workflow set up.

Now the next step is to integrate debugging into Emacs, so you don‚Äôt have to jump to another terminal for gdb.
üîπ Running GDB in Emacs

Emacs comes with M-x gdb built in.

    Open your project in Emacs.

    Run:

M-x gdb

and type:

    arm-none-eabi-gdb -i=mi main.elf

    (-i=mi tells GDB to use the "machine interface" that Emacs understands for the debugger UI).

üîπ Connect to target (OpenOCD or stlink)

If you use OpenOCD, after M-x gdb:

target remote localhost:3333
monitor reset halt
load
continue

If you use stlink/st-util, after M-x gdb:

target extended-remote localhost:4242
monitor reset halt
load
continue

üîπ Better Emacs GDB UI

Inside M-x gdb, enable multi-window mode:

(setq gdb-many-windows t)

Add that to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el, then Emacs will show:

    Source code window

    Breakpoints window

    Stack trace window

    Locals/registers

üîπ Automating with .gdbinit

To avoid typing commands each time, create a file .gdbinit in your project:

For OpenOCD:

target remote localhost:3333
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

For stlink/st-util:

target extended-remote localhost:4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

Now Emacs + GDB auto-connects when you hit M-x gdb.

‚ö° So right now you can:

    M-x compile ‚Üí runs make flash (you already have this üëç)

    M-x gdb ‚Üí runs arm-none-eabi-gdb and attaches to your MCU for debugging

Do you want me to give you a ready-to-use Emacs config snippet so you can just hit one shortcut key (say F5) to compile + flash + start gdb in one go?
You said:
target extended-remote localhost:4242
ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly the right command if you‚Äôre using stlink‚Äôs GDB server (st-util).

Here‚Äôs the workflow step by step for your STM32 on Arch + Emacs:
1. Start the stlink GDB server

In one terminal (outside Emacs):

st-util

You should see something like:

st-util 1.7.0
2025-08-18T12:34:56 INFO common.c: F4xx: 64k flash, 16k RAM
Listening at *:4242...

This means your MCU is ready for GDB connections.
2. Start GDB inside Emacs

In Emacs:

M-x gdb

and type:

arm-none-eabi-gdb -i=mi main.elf

3. Connect to the MCU

Inside the Emacs GDB prompt:

target extended-remote localhost:4242

4. Halt, load, run

monitor reset halt   # stop CPU
load                 # flash your ELF
monitor reset init   # reset again
continue             # run

5. Optional: Automate with .gdbinit

In your project folder, make .gdbinit:

target extended-remote localhost:4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

Now when you launch GDB in Emacs, it auto-connects and flashes the program.

‚ö° Question: do you want me to give you an Emacs config snippet where pressing, say, F5 will:

    Run make flash

    Start st-util

    Attach arm-none-eabi-gdb automatically?

That way you won‚Äôt need to type target extended-remote localhost:4242 manually each time.
You said:
localhost:4242
: cannot resolve name: Servname not supported for ai_socktype
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see what‚Äôs happening ‚ö° ‚Äî that error

localhost:4242
: cannot resolve name: Servname not supported for ai_socktype

usually means GDB is trying to resolve "localhost:4242" as if it were a hostname string instead of host:port.
Some GDB builds are picky about syntax.

‚úÖ Fixes you can try:
1. Use :1234 style

Instead of:

target extended-remote localhost:4242

try:

target extended-remote :4242

This explicitly means ‚Äúconnect to port 4242 on localhost‚Äù.
2. Use 127.0.0.1

Sometimes localhost resolution breaks, so:

target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:4242

3. Confirm st-util is listening

When you run:

st-util

you should see something like:

Listening at *:4242...

and you can check:

ss -tlnp | grep 4242

‚ö° So inside Emacs GDB, try one of these:

target extended-remote :4242

or

target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:4242

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to embed this into a .gdbinit file, so Emacs doesn‚Äôt complain and just works every time?
You said:
st-util 1.8.0
2025-08-18T12:21:08 INFO common.c: STM32F07x: 16 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash in at least 2 KiB pages.
2025-08-18T12:21:08 INFO gdb-server.c: Listening at *:4242...
when type st-util
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî that means your ST-Link and board are working fine, and st-util is running a GDB server on port 4242.

Now the only missing step is to attach GDB correctly.
1. In another terminal (or in Emacs via M-x gdb)

Run:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

2. Connect to the running GDB server

Inside GDB, type either of these (both should work):

target extended-remote :4242

or

target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:4242

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid localhost:4242 because some builds of GDB on Arch choke on it (that‚Äôs the Servname not supported for ai_socktype error you saw).
3. Typical debugging sequence

Once connected:

monitor reset halt   # stop CPU
load                 # flash your ELF to MCU
monitor reset init   # reset CPU to beginning
continue             # run your program

4. Optional: automate with .gdbinit

Make a .gdbinit file in your project directory:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

Now when you launch arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf, it will auto-connect and flash.

üëâ Do you want me to show you how to integrate this into Emacs, so M-x gdb automatically runs arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf, connects to :4242, and is ready to debug without typing commands each time?
You said:
on terminal working inside emacs not working 
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî if it works in the terminal GDB, but not inside Emacs GUD/GDB, then the issue is with how Emacs passes the target extended-remote command to GDB.

By default, Emacs‚Äô GUD runs GDB with something like:

gdb --fullname main.elf

and then you type commands inside the Emacs GUD buffer. But some versions of Emacs mess up when you type target extended-remote localhost:4242.
‚úÖ Fix 1: Use :4242 inside Emacs

In your Emacs GUD buffer, try:

target extended-remote :4242

instead of localhost:4242.
‚úÖ Fix 2: Create .gdbinit

In your project root, create a file named .gdbinit:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

Now when you run M-x gdb and point it to arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf, Emacs GDB will execute those automatically.
‚úÖ Fix 3: Configure Emacs init

Add this to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el (or ~/.emacs):

(setq gdb-many-windows t)        ;; Enable nice GDB UI
(setq gdb-show-main t)           ;; Jump to main on start

(defun my-gdb ()
  "Start GDB with STM32 remote debugging preset."
  (interactive)
  (gdb (concat "arm-none-eabi-gdb -i=mi main.elf")))

;; Optional: automatically send target command after gdb launches
(defun my-gdb-hook ()
  (gdb-input "target extended-remote :4242\n"))

(add-hook 'gdb-mode-hook 'my-gdb-hook)

Then you can just run:

M-x my-gdb

and it will launch arm-none-eabi-gdb, connect to :4242, and be ready.

‚ö° Question for you: do you want Emacs just for simple debugging (single GUD buffer), or the full multi-window GDB dashboard (locals, stack, breakpoints, source) when debugging STM32?
You said:
then what to do
ChatGPT said:

Nice ‚Äî you‚Äôre almost there üëç

Since GDB works fine in your terminal but not inside Emacs, the fix depends on how you want to debug:
üîπ Quickest Fix (recommended first)

    In your project folder, create .gdbinit:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

    Start st-util in one terminal:

st-util

    In Emacs, run:

M-x gdb

and enter:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

‚û°Ô∏è GDB will read .gdbinit, auto-connect to :4242, and load your program.
No need to type target extended-remote manually.
üîπ If .gdbinit is ignored

Add this line to ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

(setq gdb-many-windows t)    ;; optional: better UI

üëâ Question for you:
Do you prefer just typing commands in the GDB buffer (minimal), or do you want the multi-window GDB dashboard in Emacs (source, stack, locals, breakpoints all side-by-side)?
You said:
program not being run
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî so your firmware is flashing fine (via make flash / st-flash), and arm-none-eabi-gdb connects to st-util, but when you continue, the program doesn‚Äôt actually run. That usually happens for 3 reasons with STM32:
üîπ 1. GDB did not reset & start the MCU

By default, when you load, the MCU stays halted. You need to tell it to reset and run:

monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

So your .gdbinit should look like this:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

üîπ 2. Wrong startup code or vector table

If the startup file (startup_stm32f072.s) is wrong, the CPU won‚Äôt jump to main.
Check these things:

    Vector table is at address 0x08000000 (flash base).

    First word = initial stack pointer.

    Second word = address of Reset_Handler.

Example minimal startup:

.section .isr_vector, "a", %progbits
.word  _estack
.word  Reset_Handler

.text
.global Reset_Handler
Reset_Handler:
    bl main
1:  b 1b

And in your linker.ld:

ENTRY(Reset_Handler)

MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
  RAM (rwx)  : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 16K
}

SECTIONS
{
  .text : {
    KEEP(*(.isr_vector))
    *(.text*)
    *(.rodata*)
    _etext = .;
  } > FLASH

  .data : AT (ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF(.text)) {
    _data = .;
    *(.data*)
    _edata = .;
  } > RAM

  .bss : {
    _bss = .;
    *(.bss*)
    *(COMMON)
    _ebss = .;
  } > RAM

  .stack (NOLOAD) : {
    . = ALIGN(8);
    _estack = . + 0x400; /* adjust if needed */
  } > RAM
}

üîπ 3. Watchdog or clock config

If your code jumps into a bad loop or watchdog resets immediately, it looks like it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt run‚Äù.
For a test, make main.c very simple:

int main(void) {
    volatile int i = 0;
    while (1) {
        i++;  // Just loop forever
    }
}

If this doesn‚Äôt run, then the issue is in your startup or linker script.

‚úÖ Next step:
Try adding the monitor reset halt; load; monitor reset init; continue sequence in .gdbinit, and use the simple infinite loop main.c.

üëâ Do you want me to write you a minimal working STM32F072 project (startup, linker, main, Makefile, and .gdbinit) so you can drop it into Emacs and confirm it runs?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect, thanks for pasting the session üôè ‚Äî this makes it very clear.

Right now, GDB is only loading the ELF (exec), but you never connected to your STM32 target. That‚Äôs why you see:

The program is not being run.
You can't do that when your target is `exec'

‚úÖ What‚Äôs missing

You need to tell GDB to connect to the debug server (ST-Link or OpenOCD).

If you‚Äôre using st-util (from stlink tools):

st-util

That runs a GDB server on port 4242.

Then, in GDB:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

If you‚Äôre using OpenOCD instead:

openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f0x.cfg

That runs a GDB server on port 3333.

Then, in GDB:

target extended-remote :3333
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

‚úÖ Fix the .gdbinit warning

You got:

warning: File ".gdbinit" auto-loading has been declined

That just means GDB refused to auto-load your project‚Äôs .gdbinit. To fix:

echo "add-auto-load-safe-path /home/amal/stm32f072_test/.gdbinit" >> ~/.config/gdb/gdbinit

(or just allow everything, but less safe)

echo "set auto-load safe-path /" >> ~/.config/gdb/gdbinit

üîπ Next Step for You

    Tell me: do you run st-util or openocd for flashing/debugging?

    Once we know that, I‚Äôll give you the exact .gdbinit so that M-x gdb in Emacs connects and runs main automatically.

üëâ Do you want me to write you a ready-to-use .gdbinit for st-util on STM32F072?
You said:
tell me what is the procedure
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç Let me give you the step-by-step debugging procedure for your STM32F072 with ST-Link.
üîπ Step 1: Build your firmware

In your project directory:

make

This gives you main.elf.
üîπ Step 2: Start the GDB server

You need something that talks to the MCU and exposes it to GDB.

For ST-Link:

st-util

You should see:

STM32F07x: 16 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash ...
Listening at *:4242...

Now the chip is waiting for GDB on TCP port 4242.
üîπ Step 3: Start GDB

In another terminal (or in Emacs M-x gdb):

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

üîπ Step 4: Connect GDB to the target

Inside GDB:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt

üîπ Step 5: Load your program to flash

load

This flashes main.elf into the MCU.
üîπ Step 6: Run with breakpoints

Set a breakpoint and run:

break main
continue

Your program should now stop at main().
üîπ Step 7: Resume or step

    Continue execution:

continue

Step through instructions:

step
next

Inspect registers/memory:

    info registers
    x/16wx 0x20000000

üîπ Optional: .gdbinit for automation

Create a .gdbinit in your project:

file main.elf
target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
break main
continue

Then GDB will automatically connect, flash, and break at main().

‚úÖ Summary workflow:

    make

    st-util (keep running)

    arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

    Inside GDB: target extended-remote :4242 ‚Üí load ‚Üí continue

Do you want me to adapt this into an Emacs .gdbinit + Makefile rule so you can just press M-x gdb ‚Üí make flash and debug automatically?
You said:
so i need to run st-util on another terminal
ChatGPT said:

Exactly ‚úÖ

You need two processes running at the same time:

    Terminal 1 ‚Üí run the GDB server (this keeps talking to the STM32 board):

st-util

Leave this running. You‚Äôll see something like:

STM32F07x: 16 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash ...
Listening at *:4242...

Terminal 2 (or Emacs gdb) ‚Üí run GDB and connect to that server:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

then inside GDB:

    target extended-remote :4242
    monitor reset halt
    load
    continue

üëâ Think of it like this:

    st-util = the bridge between your PC and STM32.

    gdb = the debugger that tells the bridge what to do.

Without st-util running in another terminal, GDB has nobody to talk to.

Do you want me to also show you how to make Emacs automatically launch both st-util and gdb so you don‚Äôt have to open two terminals manually?
You said:
target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
continue
this i have in .gdbinit
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre already on the right track.

Your .gdbinit has the right sequence, but here‚Äôs the complete working procedure for STM32 with st-util:
Step 1 ‚Äî Start the GDB server

In Terminal 1 (outside Emacs):

st-util

Keep this running. It will print:

STM32F07x: 16 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash ...
Listening at *:4242...

Step 2 ‚Äî Launch GDB

In Terminal 2 or inside Emacs:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

Because you have this in .gdbinit:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
continue

GDB will automatically:

    Connect to st-util (target extended-remote :4242)

    Reset and halt the MCU (monitor reset halt)

    Load your main.elf into flash (load)

    Start running (continue)

Step 3 ‚Äî Debug

Now you can:

break main
continue
step
next
info registers

‚ö†Ô∏è But note: .gdbinit auto-loading was blocked in your earlier log. GDB ignored your .gdbinit.
You must fix that once:

echo "add-auto-load-safe-path /home/amal/stm32f072_test/.gdbinit" >> ~/.config/gdb/gdbinit

‚úÖ After this, every time you just do:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

it will auto-connect to st-util, reset, flash, and run.

Do you want me to also make Emacs launch st-util automatically in the background so you don‚Äôt need two separate terminals?
You said:
if i want to check the program without running how to do it
ChatGPT said:

Ah, good question üëç ‚Äî right now your .gdbinit ends with

load
continue

That makes it immediately flash the firmware and start running, which is not what you want if you‚Äôd like to inspect or single-step without free-running.
‚úÖ Two Options
1. Change .gdbinit

Remove or comment out the continue line so that the MCU halts after reset and program load:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
# continue   <-- comment this

Then, after launching arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf, the MCU will be halted at reset and you can:

break main
stepi
next

2. Skip load if firmware is already flashed

If you only want to attach and inspect the current program (without reflashing every time), make .gdbinit like this:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt

Then you can just debug the program as it is in flash, for example:

break main
continue

‚ö° Workflow Examples

    Flash + debug (halt at start, don‚Äôt run):

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load

    Attach to running firmware (don‚Äôt flash):

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt

üëâ Do you want me to give you a .gdbinit that has both options (choose at runtime with a command), so you don‚Äôt need to edit the file each time?

.gdbinit:1: Error in sourced command file:
could not connect: Connection timed out.
i am not connected to my board right now so is it ok
ChatGPT said:

Yes üëç that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

    Your .gdbinit tries to connect immediately to the board with

    target extended-remote :4242

    Since you don‚Äôt have st-util running or the board plugged in, GDB times out ‚Üí that‚Äôs the error you see.

It‚Äôs not a problem with your setup ‚Äî it only means the target isn‚Äôt present right now.
üõ†Ô∏è Two ways to avoid the error when the board isn‚Äôt connected:

    Ignore it
    If you only want to work on symbols (inspect variables, disassembly, etc.), you can still run commands in GDB ‚Äî just skip the target-related commands.

    Make .gdbinit conditional
    You can wrap the target connection in a python block that doesn‚Äôt error out if it can‚Äôt connect. For example, put this in your ~/.gdbinit:

define connect_target
  target extended-remote :4242
  monitor reset halt
end

Then when you‚Äôre offline, GDB won‚Äôt complain. When you want to connect, just type inside GDB:

    connect_target

üëâ So yes, the timeout is expected if the board isn‚Äôt connected.
Do you want me to write you a clean .gdbinit template that works both when the board is present and when it isn‚Äôt (no errors at startup)?
You said:
target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
this is .gdbinit file
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç ‚Äî right now your .gdbinit always tries to:

    connect to st-util on port 4242

    reset + halt the MCU

    load the program into flash

    reset + init again

That‚Äôs perfect when your board + st-util are running, but when they aren‚Äôt, GDB errors out (like you saw).
‚úÖ Safer .gdbinit template

You can wrap these in a command instead of running them automatically at startup:

# Load ELF file (symbols only)
file main.elf

# Define a custom command to connect + flash
define connect_target
    target extended-remote :4242
    monitor reset halt
    load
    monitor reset init
end

document connect_target
Connect to st-util (port 4242), halt, load firmware, and reset init.
Usage: connect_target
end

üîπ How this helps

    When the board is not connected ‚Üí GDB just loads your ELF file and symbols, no errors.

    When you actually want to flash + debug:

    connect_target

üëâ This way, you can still inspect your ELF (symbols, disassembly, breakpoints) without hardware, and only run connect_target when your board + st-util are ready.

Do you want me to also show you how to simulate execution without a board (just inside GDB, no hardware)?

.gdbinit:1: Error in sourced command file:
could not connect: Connection timed out.
ChatGPT said:

Yes üëç that‚Äôs exactly what I meant earlier ‚Äî your .gdbinit is trying to connect to st-util at startup, but since the board + server aren‚Äôt running, GDB immediately fails with

Error in sourced command file:
could not connect: Connection timed out.

That‚Äôs normal behavior.
Why this happens

Your .gdbinit starts with:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

So GDB always expects st-util on port 4242. If it isn‚Äôt running, you get the timeout.
Fix: make .gdbinit non-blocking

Instead of forcing a connection every time, load symbols first, and only connect when hardware is ready:

# Load program symbols only
file main.elf

# Define a command to connect to the board when ready
define connect_target
    target extended-remote :4242
    monitor reset halt
    load
    monitor reset init
end

Now:

    Run arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf ‚Üí works fine without hardware.

    When hardware + st-util are running, inside GDB just type:

    connect_target

üëâ Question: Do you want me to also show you how to use GDB to step through your code without a board (simulation / dry run), or do you only care about real hardware debugging?
You said:
i did same thing and code also same
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç then you‚Äôre already on the right track.

So now, two cases:
üîπ When board is not connected

    You just open GDB with:

    arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

    It will load your ELF symbols.

    You can inspect code, disassemble, set breakpoints, check symbol addresses, etc.
    (but of course you can‚Äôt run because there‚Äôs no target).

Example:

info functions
disassemble main
list

üîπ When board is connected

    In another terminal:

st-util

(it will say Listening at *:4242...)

In Emacs or terminal:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

Inside GDB:

    connect_target   # your custom command from .gdbinit
    continue

Now flashing + running works.

‚úÖ So yes, the timeout you saw earlier is expected when the board isn‚Äôt connected.
Nothing is wrong with your .gdbinit.

Do you want me to show you how to simulate / test-run your STM32 code without hardware (e.g., QEMU for Cortex-M0), so you can debug even without the board?

ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç The error

WARN usb.c: Couldn't find any ST-Link devices

means that st-flash (from stlink) cannot talk to your programmer/debugger.
Let‚Äôs go step by step:
‚úÖ Checklist for st-flash

    Is the ST-Link device plugged in?

        If you‚Äôre using a Nucleo or Discovery board, the ST-Link is built in.

        If you‚Äôre using a bare STM32 board, you need an external ST-Link dongle.

    Check if Linux sees it:

lsusb | grep -i st-link

You should see something like:

Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0483:3748 STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2

If nothing shows ‚Üí the cable/port is bad, or device not connected.

Check permissions (udev rules):

    By default, only root can talk to USB programmers.

    Quick test:

sudo st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000

If this works ‚Üí it‚Äôs a permissions issue.

To fix permanently:

        sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/49-stlinkv2.rules <<EOF
        SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0483", ATTR{idProduct}=="3748", MODE="0666"
        SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0483", ATTR{idProduct}=="374b", MODE="0666"
        SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0483", ATTR{idProduct}=="374d", MODE="0666"
        EOF
        sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
        sudo udevadm trigger

        Then unplug + replug your board.

    Make sure no other tool is using ST-Link:

        If st-util is already running, st-flash can‚Äôt connect.

        Kill it before flashing.

üëâ So first test with:

sudo st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000

Do you want me to also show you how to flash directly from inside GDB (without st-flash), since you already have .gdbinit set up? That way you can avoid this error altogether.
You said:
lsusb not found using arch
ChatGPT said:

Ah üëç Arch Linux keeps things very minimal, so lsusb isn‚Äôt in the base system.
It comes from the package usbutils.

To install it:

sudo pacman -S usbutils

Then check if your ST-Link is visible:

lsusb | grep -i st-link

You should see something like:

Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0483:3748 STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2

‚ö° If lsusb shows the ST-Link ‚Üí we know the hardware is detected, and then we only need to fix udev rules/permissions.
‚ö° If nothing shows up ‚Üí either cable/board issue, or the USB interface isn‚Äôt enumerating at all.

Do you want me to also give you the Arch-specific udev rules for ST-Link so you don‚Äôt need sudo st-flash every time?

The problem isn‚Äôt your build ‚Äî it‚Äôs the connection to the MCU.
st-flash is telling you:

ERROR common.c: Failed to read core_id
Can not connect to target. Please use 'connect under reset' and try again

That means the ST-Link is visible, but it can‚Äôt talk to the STM32.
This usually happens if:

    The MCU is stuck in a bad state (locked in sleep/low power mode).

    Wrong BOOT pin configuration.

    Bad USB cable or power issue.

    You need to reset the chip during connection.

‚úÖ Fix options

    Try "connect under reset"

st-flash --reset write main.bin 0x08000000

or with GDB/st-util:

st-util --reset

    Check BOOT0/BOOT1 pins

    BOOT0 should be tied low (GND) for normal flash programming.

    If it‚Äôs high, the MCU runs from system bootloader, not user flash.

    Ensure board is powered correctly
    Some Nucleo boards get power via USB, some need external 3.3V.

    Try erasing the chip first

st-flash erase

then re-run:

st-flash write main.bin 0x08000000

    If still stuck ‚Üí use GDB instead of st-flash
    Start:

st-util

Then in another terminal:

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf
(gdb) target extended-remote :4242
(gdb) monitor reset halt
(gdb) load
(gdb) continue

üëâ Question for you: are you flashing a Nucleo board (with onboard ST-Link) or a bare STM32F072 chip + external ST-Link V2 dongle?
That will change whether we need to worry about BOOT pins/power.

Perfect ‚Äî this log means:

    st-util did connect to your STM32F072. ‚úÖ

    It exposed a GDB server on port 4242.

    Your arm-none-eabi-gdb connected (Found 4 hw breakpoint registers).

    Then it suddenly dropped (cannot recv: -2) ‚Üí usually GDB closed the connection or crashed because of a mis-step.

‚ö° Correct procedure (step by step)

    Start st-util in one terminal

st-util

You should see:

STM32F07x: 16 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash ...
Listening at *:4242...

    In another terminal, start gdb

arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf

    Inside gdb, run:

target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

üëâ Don‚Äôt put all of this in .gdbinit right now. Do it manually first to confirm connection.
Later we can automate in .gdbinit.
Why you saw cannot recv: -2

That happens if:

    GDB exited early (e.g., .gdbinit tried to load before connection).

    Board reset while debugging (unstable power / BOOT pins).

    Old .gdbinit automatically runs commands before st-util is ready.

‚úÖ Try the manual step sequence above (don‚Äôt auto-load via .gdbinit).

Would you like me to also give you a safe .gdbinit template that won‚Äôt crash when board is disconnected, but only executes if connection works?

That‚Äôs expected üëç ‚Äî your STM32‚Äôs GDB server (st-util) doesn‚Äôt support non-stop mode (that‚Äôs for advanced multi-core/trace targets).

When you see:

Non-stop mode requested, but remote does not support non-stop

‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a warning, not a failure.
‚úÖ Fix / Workaround

Tell GDB to use all-stop mode (the normal mode for MCUs like STM32):

Inside GDB, run:

set non-stop off

You can also add it at the top of your .gdbinit:

set non-stop off
target extended-remote :4242
monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init
continue

Summary

    The message is harmless.

    Just disable non-stop once and you won‚Äôt see it again.

    Debugging will then work as expected.

üëâ Do you want me to give you a minimal clean .gdbinit that works whether the board is connected or not (without throwing scary errors)?
